# Pieces
### By Ahnaf Hasan, Iman Ali, Vincent Chi, Tommy Lin

Pieces is a web application developed for artists, level designers, and game designers for the purposes of creating tilesets, and tile maps. It also facilitates connectivity amongst the game community by allowing collaboration on projects and a public marketplace to browse and potentially use others' work. Our goal is to create a web community that not only lets users create and share their maps and tilesets but also promotes interaction between fellow designers with features to offer feedback to publicly shared creations by liking, disliking, and commenting . Some of the competitors who offer similar services are Tilesetter and Tiled, which are tools that let users make tilesets and maps. However, these tools don’t offer an integrated online platform to share and collaborate on their maps. We also aim to make our product more intuitive and satisfying to use than software like Tiled and Tilesetter, pushing the envelope forward and making it the new optimal choice for artists, level designers, and game designers.
